## Description

It is common for websites to change based on a users location, it would be interesting to see it change based on a users time. This is essentially a play on day and night modes, but we can have automatic changes to "morning mode", "afternoon mode", "night mode", etc. I want each design to be created from scratch by the team members. This will be beginner friendly as I want it to be a project where we can learn product design, collaboration, and coding together.

#### Technologies
